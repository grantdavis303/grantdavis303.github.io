## About Me

* Who am I?
* Why am I in this field?
* What’s next for me?

## Projects (2)

The main recommendation here is to remember that you are speaking to potential employers, not investors. These project descriptions should briefly describe the project, and then quickly pivot to describing your primary contributions and the things you learned. This is an advertisement for you, not the project. Be consistent in your project descriptions. Too often students use different formats and headings for each of their project descriptions. It can help your audience of potential employers to quickly digest this information if you are even consistent between projects in the order in which you provide information.

For example:

First sentence: name of project, number of collaborators, primary technologies used, what it does.
Second sentence: main learning goals of the project/the things you were doing for the first time in this project (if you don’t know, ask your instructors).
Third sentence: any stretch goals you were able to achieve.
Fourth sentence: anything you specifically focused on in the project.
