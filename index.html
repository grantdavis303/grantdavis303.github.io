    <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>
        My journey in tech started a long, long time ago. All the way back in 2010, I wrote my very first code creating basic (and I mean basic) HTML and CSS web pages using Windows Notepad. <br>
        <br>
        After moving to Colorado in 2011, I stopped writing code and pursued other interests of mine at the time - photography and video production. I combined this interest in creative visual communication with a business mindset and graduated from CU Boulder with a degree in Strategic Communication. Shortly after graduating and navigating the craziness that was 2020, I started working full-time as the marketing coordinator for a local non-profit in the electrical industry. <br>
        <br>
        Truthfully, that interest in writing code never went away, and in January of 2024, I began the backend engineering program at Turing, a software engineering bootcamp based in Denver, Colorado. Although I had previous experience in marketing and design, I decided to pursue backend engineering because it was completely new and unknown to me, and I was excited about that challenge. <br>
        <br>
        During my time at Turing, I’ve worked on many great teams of all different sizes and have successfully built and deployed several projects. I really enjoy working with relational databases, building REST APIs, developing dynamic web applications, and managing the overall flow of data. My technical toolkit currently includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and SQL, and I am eager to explore other languages and tools like Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. <br>
        <br>
        I am currently looking to join a team where I can continue to learn and expand my technical skills. If you’re interested in discussing my career journey, anything tech, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
